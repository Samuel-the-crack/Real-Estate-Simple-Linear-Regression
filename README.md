# Real-Estate-Simple-Linear-Regression
This is a basic implementation of simple linear regression


## Simple Linear Regression Using OLS (Ordinary Least Square)
This is the code implementation of simple linear regression. In this code I'm using python's statsmodel module to implement **OLS (Ordinary Least Square)** method of linear regression, for complete information aobut statsmodel's OLS, I suggest to visit [This Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ordinary-least-squares-ols-using-statsmodels/).

Requirements  : **Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Statsmodel**

## Overview
This code is using 'real_estate_price_size.csv' as an input (I enclose the file in this repository). After importing the csv data usisng **pandas** I'm declaring the dependent and the independent variables wich are Price and Size. Since the variable declared I'm doing the regression with **statsmodel** and then visualizing it with **matplotlib** scatter and draw the regression line within.
